A stiffness matrix is a mathematical representation of the stiffness or rigidity of a structure or system. It is a square matrix that relates the forces applied to a structure to the resulting displacements. The elements of the matrix represent the stiffness of each component of the structure and how they are connected to each other. The stiffness matrix is used in structural analysis and finite element analysis to determine the behavior and response of a structure under different loading conditions. It is an important tool in engineering design and analysis, as it allows engineers to predict and optimize the performance of a structure.
