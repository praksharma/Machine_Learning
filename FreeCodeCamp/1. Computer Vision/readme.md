## Using Tensorflow on a GPU without any errors
Looks like Tensorflow still doesn't connect (30 Sep 2023) to every single GPU OOTB. The easiest way to use Tensorflow is to use their docker image. There are three types of docker images available for [Tensorflow](https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/) ending with:
* latest
* latest-gpu
* latest-gpu-jupyter

In this case I am using the last one. First, pull the image.
```sh
docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-jupyter 
```
Run the container with a jupyter server:

```sh
docker run -it --rm --runtime=nvidia tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-jupyter
```
Here we don't need to bind any path, we will do this in VS Code. In fact, VS Code has its own Docker container extension (pre-installed), but I couldn't find a way to add the `--runtime` flag.

Now open the VS Code in your project directory. Open the Jupyter notebook. Now on the top right corner where it says "Select kernel". Click there and choose "Select another kernel" then "Existing Jupyter server". In the box that pops up, just paste the complete URL of the Jupyter server (includes the token) from the terminal.

Now run this to confirm that your GPU is recognised.
```python
Import tensorflow as tf
tf. config. list_physical_devices()
```

You should get an output similar to this:

```python
[PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:CPU:0', device_type='CPU'),
 PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:GPU:0', device_type='GPU')]
```

## Installing packages
So, Tensorflow's docker image doesn't include essential packages such as `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib` etc.

Start an interactive bash terminal inside the docker image using this command:
```sh
 docker run -it  --runtime=nvidia tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-jupyter /bin/bash
 ```

 Now install anything you like to.
 ```sh
 pip3 install pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
 ```

Don't close the interactive session. Open a new terminal and type the following to see a lit of active containers.

```sh
docker container ls
```
You should see something like this.
```sh
╰─ docker container ls                                                       ─╯
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                      COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES
5d81a1fcd9cb   tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-jupyter   "/bin/bash"              3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes   8888/tcp                                    sweet_poitras
e2de8ead53a3   tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-jupyter   "bash -c 'source /et…"   5 hours ago     Up 5 hours     0.0.0.0:8888->8888/tcp, :::8888->8888/tcp   unruffled_curran
```

Now note down the container ID of the active container. Now we will write the changes made to the container to a new image.

```sh
╰─ sudo docker commit 5d81a1fcd9cb tf_ml                                                                                           ─╯
sha256:773e0145d7965a1f67f1c89d16a5c459e4b8c0de064cebfe7aeb937f7f4932cb
```

Now the newly created docker image should reflect the changes made in the container.
