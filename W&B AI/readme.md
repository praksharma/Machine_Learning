# Weights & Biases

[Weights & Biases](https://github.com/wandb/wandb) is a drop-in replacement of MLflow and Hydra. That is why I decided to give it a try. [Here](https://medium.com/hub-by-littlebigcode/why-do-you-need-to-use-weights-biases-to-track-your-ml-project-f093562287d8) is a comparison between MLflow and W&B.
